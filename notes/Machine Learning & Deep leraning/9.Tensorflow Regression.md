What are Model Parameter in Deep Leaning , and How to calculate it ?

### Model Parameters

Model Parameters are properties of training data that will learn during the learning process, in the case of deep learning is weight and bias. Parameter is often used as a measure of how well a model is performing. For example, [ResNet-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model has over 23 million trainable parameters, and for [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) it has approx 175 billion parameters.

### Where Did The Numbers Come From ?

The total number of parameters is the sum of all the weights and biases on the neural network.when calculating manually, different type of layers have different methods. The parameters on the Dense, conv2d, or maybe LSTM laters are slightly different.**The principle is the same, we only need to calculate the unit weight and bias.**

### Dense Layer

For starters we’ll start with the Dense layer. A dense layer is just regular layer of neurons in neural network. Each neuron receive input from all the neuron in the previous layer, and fully connected.

As shown in illustration 1, on the input layer we have 4 input units. And in the hidden layer we have a dense layer with 2 units. Lets say at input layer we have **X = {x1, x2, x3, x4}**, and in the **hidden layer we have a1, a2**.

**a1 = x1.w11 + x2.w12 + x3.w13 + x4.w14 + b1**

**a2 = x1.w21 + x2.w22 + x3.w23 + x4.w24 + b2**

from the equation it is found that the sum of all weights is 8 which consist of all **W= {w11, w12, w13, w14, w21, w22, w23, w24}**, and the bias that consist of **B = {b1, b2}**. Then the total weight and bias is 8+2=10 parameter. If we check it using tensorflow we will get the same amount.
