# what we are going to cover

1. Architecture of neural network
2. input shape and output shapes of `classfication` model (feature and label)
3. creating custom data to view and fit
4.  steps in modelling
	* creating a model, compiling a model, fitting a model, evaluating a model
5. Different `classfication` evaluation methods
6. Saving and loading the model
