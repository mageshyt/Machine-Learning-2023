	normally we developer write `function` and give `inputs`  to the machine that perform the `task` and give `output`

   in ML we give `set of inputs` and Machine Write the `function / Model`
   



# What we're covering in the Scikit-Learn Introduction


his notebook outlines the content convered in the Scikit-Learn Introduction.

It's a quick stop to see all the Scikit-Learn functions and modules for each section outlined.

What we're covering follows the following diagram detailing a Scikit-Learn workflow.

# Choosing the right Estimator/ algorithm for your problem

some things to note:

* Sklearn refer to machine learning models, algorithm as estimators
* classification problem - predicting a category (heart disease or not)
	* Something you'will see `clf` (classifier) used as a classification estimator
 * Regression problem - predicting a number (selling price of a car)
