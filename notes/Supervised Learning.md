 # What is Logistic Regression?
 
==It’s a classification algorithm, that is used where the response variable is== ==_categorical_====. The idea of Logistic Regression is to find a ==**relationship between features and probability of particular outcome**==

> **Pros**

- Simple and efficient.
- Low variance.
- It provides **probability** score for observations.

> **Cons:**

- Doesn’t handle **large** number of categorical features/variables well.
- It requires transformation of non-linear features.

# K-Nearest Neighbor

![[Pasted image 20230531165303.png]]
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both regression and classification. KNN tries to predict the correct class for the test data by calculating the distance between the test data and all the training points. Then select the K number of points which is closet to the test data. The KNN algorithm calculates the probability of the test data belonging to the classes of ‘K’ training data and class holds the highest probability will be selected. In the case of regression, the value is the mean of the ‘K’ selected training points.

Let see the below example to make it a better understanding
